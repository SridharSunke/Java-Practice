LAMBDA USES



Advantages of lambda expressions

    It reduces the lines of code.
    It supports sequential and parallel execution by passing behavior in methods with collection stream API.
    Using Stream API and lambda expression we can achieve higher efficiency (parallel execution) in the case of bulk operations on collections.
