//we cannot create object for interface and abstract class

why private methods are intoduced in java9 in interface?

a)Using private methods, now encapsulation is possible in interfaces as well.

Static and defaults methods since Java 8
Private methods since java 9


q)what is diff between classes and interfaces from java9

interface are used to do multiple inheritance
classes are used to maintain state

also interfaces cannot have fields and constructor


q)two seprate class with two diff methods, how to use both methods in single class

3 ways

The first is aggregation: make a class that takes those two activities as fields.

The second is to use interfaces.

The third is to rethink your design


q)opps concepts how implemented in java

abstarction---previous quetions sample
encapsulatin
polymorfisam--run time--overloading
			comple time-overriding
			
inheritance--abstract class and interface


aggregation--is a--constructor pass
composition--has a----private varaible
assosiation---usea a--method
